# Alby's dotfiles

My dotfiles, heavily based on [voidrice](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/voidrice).

- Very useful scripts are in `~/.local/bin/`
- Settings for:
	- nvim (text editor)
	- zsh (shell)
	- lf (file manager)
	- mpv (video player)
	- other stuff like xdg default programs, inputrc and more, etc.
- I try to minimize what's directly in `~` so:
	- All configs that can be in `~/.config/` are.
	- Some environmental variables have been set in `~/.zprofile` to move configs into `~/.config/`
- Bookmarks in text files used by various scripts (like `~/.local/bin/shortcuts`)
	- File bookmarks in `~/.config/shell/bm-files`
	- Directory bookmarks in `~/.config/shell/bm-dirs`
